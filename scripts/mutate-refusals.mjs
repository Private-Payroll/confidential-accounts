/**
 * MUTATING THE THINGS `X10` CLAIMS. `docs/NEXT.md` X10.
 *
 * The harness `scripts/mutate-app-origin.mjs` built for `X1`, aimed at the
 * three claims this round makes that are worth nothing if nothing watches them.
 *
 * **THE REDACTION IS MUTATED ONCE PER PATH, SEPARATELY, AND THE ROUND SAID SO
 * IN AS MANY WORDS.** `X10` §1 sends text to disk down two new routes — the
 * service writing why it refused, and the page keeping a refusal's body beside
 * its status — and each redacts at its own boundary. **One mutation covering
 * both would prove nothing**: break either alone and the other still hides the
 * secret, so a single mutation SURVIVES and proves the opposite of what it
 * looks like it proves. That is the lesson `X4` wrote down when it built this
 * redactor with a layer on each side, and it is why `wrap` deliberately does
 * NOT redact a third time in the middle.
 *
 * **02 IS AN ORDER AND NOT A CALL**, which is the one worth reading. Removing
 * the page's redaction outright would survive — `record` redacts again a line
 * later. What cannot survive is redacting AFTER the length cap: a
 * sixty-four character key cut in half is twenty hex characters, under every
 * threshold the redactor has, and it reaches the wire whole in spirit.
 *
 * FIVE SUITES, and the last is here because it must not become collateral: the
 * screen environment `X10` §3 added is what proves a payroll screen renders at
 * all, and a config change that switches it off silently is exactly the failure
 * `C67` cost the wallet.
 *
 * THREE REFUSALS, ALL BORROWED FROM `MUTATE.command`:
 *
 *   · **stale mutation** — the text it edits is not in the file any more.
 *   · **ambiguous target** — the text appears more than once.
 *   · **stale expectation** — a test it names is not in the suite any more.
 *
 * AND THE ONE THAT MATTERS: **a mutation that SURVIVES is a hole.**
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/mutate-refusals.mjs [--only=1,3] [--report=PATH]

 * **A KILLED RUN PUTS THE FILE BACK, AND IT DOES NOT RELY ON A SIGNAL.**
 * Found the hard way, PI2b, twice.
 *
 * The mutation is written to disk, the suite runs, and a `finally` restores it.
 * **Neither a `finally` nor a signal handler is any use here**, and the second
 * one is the trap: `runSuite` uses `execFileSync`, which BLOCKS THE EVENT LOOP,
 * so a `SIGTERM` arriving mid-suite is queued and cannot be serviced until the
 * call it would have interrupted has already finished. A `SIGKILL` is never
 * delivered to JavaScript at all. This harness runs under a 45-second
 * call cap, so being killed part way through is the ORDINARY case, not the
 * exotic one.
 *
 * It happened here. A timeout landed between the write and the restore and left
 * `src/core/company-address.ts` holding `if (false)` — **a disarmed guard, in a
 * working tree, that compiles and typechecks and is indistinguishable from one
 * that was never written.** The first fix was signal handlers; they did not
 * work, for the reason above, and it happened a second time.
 *
 * So the record of what is in flight lives ON DISK, written before the mutation
 * and deleted after the restore. Nothing has to survive for it to work: the
 * NEXT run reads it, puts the file back and says so before doing anything else.
 * The window in which a tree can be left mutated is now bounded by "until
 * somebody runs this again", and it announces itself rather than being found by
 * grep.
